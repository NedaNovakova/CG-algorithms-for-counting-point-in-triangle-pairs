The code in this repository was used for an experimental evaluation of three algorithms for counting point-in-triangle pairs.

The following three algorithms can be found in the `Algorithms` folder:
- Brute-Force
- Plane-Sweep
- KD-Search based algorithm

The datasets used for the experiments are located in `data`.
The code used to generate datasets can be found in `dataset_gen.py`.
